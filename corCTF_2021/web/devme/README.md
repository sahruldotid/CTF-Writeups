No source code attached, so i try to test the feature one by one. After few second, i've found that the sign up (located at bottom home page) is sending graphql query into https://devme.be.ax/graphql. Since we know that graphql is provided of introspection query by default (cmiiw), we can use GraphiQL tools  [Here](https://www.electronjs.org/apps/graphiql).
